# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

In this project, a sentiment classifier that I used NLP techniques (LSTM, BERT, and Linear SVC), is built which evaluates the polarity of a piece of text being either positive or negative. Given the availability of a large volume of online review data (IMDB), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important.

# IMDB Dataset

#### *IMDB dataset has 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics*c
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.


# Data Preprocessing

Common English stopwords were removed. An English stopwords reference ('stopwords.en') is given in the code for reference. then manipulate labels of sentiment, 1 for positive and 0 for negative. in addition to the process of clearing punctuation marks in data, cleaning unnecessary marks in data, capitalization to lowercase, and cleaning extra spaces in addition to Removing html strips and noise text.
