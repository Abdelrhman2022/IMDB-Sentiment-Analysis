# IMDB Sentiment Analysis
In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of a piece of text being either positive or negative. Given the availability of a large volume of online review data (IMDB), sentiment analysis becomes increasingly important. 


# IMDB Dataset

#### IMDB dataset has 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
